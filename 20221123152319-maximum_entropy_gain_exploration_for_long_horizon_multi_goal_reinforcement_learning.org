#+title: Maximum Entropy Gain Exploration for Long Horizon Multi-goal Reinforcement Learning
#+filetags: :sequential:


Same idea with [[id:E16E8A92-C645-4DE0-A936-5B6A48276F38][Skew-Fit: State-Covering Self-Supervised Reinforcement Learning]]. Trying to maximize the distribution of less visited archived goals, that is  also the idea of maximize the entropy of $H(S)$.

_But the structure of subgoal exploration algorithm organized by this paper is really great._
