!SHIT! The above answer is wrong!

It's better not to change the permision of Nix Store by ourself.

First, try to check if the nix-daemon is stared:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo launchctl list | grep org.nixos
#+end_src

If not, start it:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/org.nixos.nix-daemon
#+end_src

Then try to use `nix run` to rebuild the system (if you don't have `/run/current-system/` in your system.

#+begin_src shell
  nix run nix-darwin --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" -- switch --flake /path/to/your/flake.nix
#+end_src

** Important Notes

#+begin_quote
When anything wired happend, remember to check if new nix command has permitted with Full Disk access.
