* Key idea

Behavioral cloning policies are often represented by explicit continuous feed-forward models that mappingg directly from input observations $o \in \mathcal{O}$ to output action $a \in \mathcal{A}$.

$$
\hat{a} = F_{\theta} (o)
$$

In this work, they reformulate BC using the composition of ~argmin~ with an energy function $E$ to represent the policy,

$$
\hat{a} = \arg\min_{a} E_{\theta} (o, a)
$$

Then train the model with different EBM training methods.

* What you can learn?

1. From explicit to implicit.
   If there's a way to transfer the methods/optimization goal from explicit to implicit, there's a way to write a paper.

* Drawbacks

Not found.
