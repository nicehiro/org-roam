#+title: Humanoid Locomotion and Manipulation: Current Progress and Challenges in Control, Planning, and Learning
#+filetags: :survey:humanoid:


* Background

** Bipedal Locomotion

Locomotion refers to the physical methods and mechanisms that enable a humanoid robot to move its body from one place to another. (Low-level motor control)

** Navigation

Navigation involves the robot's ability to determine its position and plan paths to reach desired locations. (High-level planning)

** Whole-body Manipulation

Antropomorphic manipulation has been the inspiration for bimanual manipulation, loco-manipulation, dexterous manipulation. The ultimate form of the antropomorphic manipulation is whole-body manipulation, referring to the ability to manipulation objects using any part of one's body.

*No robot self mobility (locomotion)*

** Loco-manipulation

As suggested by its name, loco-manipulation involves both the movement of the objects throught manipulation and the mobility of the robot self through locomotion.

*No All surface interaction (whole-body)*

** Whole-body loco-manipulation

Humanoid whole-body loco-manipulation needs to schedule contact for all limbs to simultaneously achieve robust movement and safe object interaction.

** Tactile Sensing

Tactile sensing is yet an underexplored modality for advancing humanoid loco-manipulation, providing direct contact information necessary for tasks involving complex interactions with environments and objects.

* Learning Loco-manipulation Skills
