#+title: What is Manipulation?


Manipulation refers to an agent's control of its environment through selective contact.

Even broader: "Open-World" manipulation requires:
- rich perceptual understanding of the environment,
- "common-sense" understanding of objects,
- the ability to make long-term (task-level) plans, and combine them with fine (joint-level) motions
