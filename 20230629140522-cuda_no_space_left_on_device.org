#+title: CUDA: No space left on device
#+filetags: :cuda:


When using pytorch in docker with cuda, I always encounter the error ~no space left on device~. That means the ~shm~ is full and we can check it by ~df -h | grep shm~.

There's two way to solve this problem:

1. Reboot the docker container. Make sure stop ~xrdp~ service in advance.

2. Increase ~shm~ size.


*The wired thing is I've already shutdown all training process, but the ~shm~ size still fully occupied.*
