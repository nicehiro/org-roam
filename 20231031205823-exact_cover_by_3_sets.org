#+title: Exact Cover by 3-Sets

* Problem Definition
Given a set $U$ with $|U| = 3n$ and a collection $C$ of 3-element subsets of $U$. Does $C$ contain an exact cover for $U$, that is, a subcollection $C^{\prime} \subset C$ such that every element of $U$ occurs in exactly one member of $C^{\prime}$?
