#+title: Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models
#+filetags: :paper:LLM:prompt:


Tree of Thoughts (ToT) extends [[id:dc79e111-6fe7-4d1e-8bcd-efe0667af4ea][CoT]] by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generate multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS or DFS with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.
