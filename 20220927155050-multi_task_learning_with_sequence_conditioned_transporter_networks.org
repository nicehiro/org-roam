#+title: Multi-Task Learning with Sequence-Conditioned Transporter Networks
#+filetags: :imitation:sequential:multi-task:rl:


This work is based on previous work [[id:2086792E-D3FB-46FE-BB17-829D27E6B8A6][Transporter Networks: Rearranging the Visual World for Robotic Manipulation]]. And like previous, they are focus on seen tasks.


Complex manipulation can be formulated as sequencing multiple individual tasks over a long horizon. Understanding task structure may be a key ingredient in scaling reinforcement learning methods to compositional tasks.

They collect demonstration images as ~v~ at every time step when the agent receive a reward, e.g., finish a subtask. And in the test process, they try to find a desired next step goal from ~v~.

The subtask can be done by using Transporter Networks.
