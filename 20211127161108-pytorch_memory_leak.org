#+title: PyTorch Memory Leak
#+filetags: :pytorch:

- Use memory profiler tools to check which line of code is leaking memory.
- Use ~.detach()~ and ~.copy()~ every time you want to save a copy of tensor.

And what's so wired is that memory leaking happened every time after
calling the Linear and ReLU modules. This is also addressed here:
