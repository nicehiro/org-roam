#+title: Structures and Classes
#+filetags: :swift:

Swift structures and classes are *much closer* in functionality than in
other languages.

* Comparing

** Common
- Properties to store values.
- Methods to provide functionality.
- Access to their values using subscript syntax(下标操作).
- Initializers to set up their initial state.
- Be *extended* to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation.
- Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind.

** Different

*** Structures

*** Classes
- Reference counting allows *more than one* reference to a class instance.
- Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
- Deinitializers(析构器) enable an instance of a class to free up any resources
  it has assigned.
