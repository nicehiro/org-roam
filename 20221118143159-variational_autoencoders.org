#+title: Variational Autoencoders
#+startup: latexpreview


General autoencoders try to generate a latent vector which can contain more information with original input while keep low dimentions. They try to generate latent vector directly by using neural network. While variational autoencoders sample latent vector by using normal distribution on latent space which is generated by neural network.


Reparametrisation trick: not sample latent representation directly by $\mu$ and $\sigma$, while using $z = \mu + \epsilon \times \sigma$ as latent representation.
