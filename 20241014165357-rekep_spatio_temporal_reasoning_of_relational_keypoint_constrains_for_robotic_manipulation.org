#+title: ReKep: Spatio-Temporal Reasoning of Relational Keypoint Constrains for Robotic Manipulation
#+filetags: :LLM:


This paper proposes a method, called Relational Keypoint Constraints (ReKep), to mapping a set of 3D keypoints in the environment to a numerical cost (formulate the constraints) by:

1. detecting keypoints of images using DINOv2
2. generating python cost functions by using GPT-4o
3. solving the sense actions of end-effector


The keypoints idea is actually not new, while the proposed ReKep cost is interesting. That makes the proposed method can handle various constraints in the environments, such as:

1. versatile to diverse tasks
2. free of manual labeling
3. optimizable by off-the-shelf solvers to produce robot actions in real-time
