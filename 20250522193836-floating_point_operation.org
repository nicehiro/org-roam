#+title: Floating-point Operation

FLOP stands for "Floating-point OPeration". It is the basic unit we count when we talk about how much numerical work an algorithm or hardware performs. A single FLOP is one arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fused-multiply-add, etc.)

FLOPS stands for FLOP per second.

* Examples

** Dot product of two length-N vectors

$$
\text{FLOPs} = 2 N
$$

** Dense layer: input x weights (M x K) to output (M x N)

$$
\text{FLOPs} = 2 MKN
$$

** 3x3 convolution, stride 1, no groups on a feature map (C channels, HÃ—W spatial)

$$
\text{FLOPs} = 9 \times H \times W \times C_{in} \times C_{out}
$$
