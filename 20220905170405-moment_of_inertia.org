#+title: Moment of Inertia


For a point mass the moment of inertia is simply the mass times the square of the perpendicular distance to the axis of rotation.

\begin{equation*}
I = m r^2
\end{equation*}

For a rigid composite system the moment of inertia is the sum of the moments of inertia of its component subsystems.

\begin{equation*}
I = \iint \rho r^2 dV
\end{equation*}
