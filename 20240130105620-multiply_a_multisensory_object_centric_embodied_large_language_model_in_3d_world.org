#+title: MultiPLY: A Multisensory Object-Centric Embodied Large Language Model in 3D World


The structure of MultiPLY:

- LLaVA (VLM) as backbone
- Using lightweight adapter (one-layer linear projector) to project the sensor features into the text token embedding space
- Modality Alighment for audio, tactile, sound, thermal data
- Collecting data and finetune it


Inputs contain RGBD data, tactile, sound sensors' data, and outputs Action tokens.
