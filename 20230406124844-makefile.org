* Compile & Link

#+begin_src
Source file (C, C++) -> Object file (.o, .obj) -> Library (Archive) file (.a, .lib)
#+end_src

Source file can be *compiled* to object file, and the compiler only check grammer and definition of function. Then the linker will *link* object file to library file by finding all needed functions from object files.

* Basic Rule

#+begin_src makefile
target ... : prerequisites ...
    command
    ...
    ...
#+end_src
