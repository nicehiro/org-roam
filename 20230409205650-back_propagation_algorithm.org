#+title: Back Propagation Algorithm

1. Forward pass: Computation of function signals for each neuron,
2. Backward pass: Starts at the output layer, recursively compute $\sigma$ for each neuron from output layer towards the first hidden layer. At each layer, the synaptic weights are changed accordingly to the delta rule:
