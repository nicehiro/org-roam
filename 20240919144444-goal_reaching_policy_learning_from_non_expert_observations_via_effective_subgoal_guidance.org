#+title: Goal-Reaching Policy Learning from Non-Expert Observations via Effective Subgoal Guidance
#+filetags: :rl:subgoal:goal-conditioned:


This work tries to tackle long-horizon tasks by leveraging non-expert, action-free observation data, which is novel (idea is used before I think but no one described like that).

It involves training a state-goal value function to encourage informative exploration (used before) and learning a high-level policy that generates reasonable subgoals. For generating subgoals, it uses[[id:4ABFDA2B-9B97-42E7-AF7F-210008EFF683][ Hindsight Experience Replay]] to sample goals from either the future states within the same trajectory or random states in the dataset (which I think is not so good).
