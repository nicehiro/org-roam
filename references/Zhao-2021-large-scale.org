#+title: Notes on Large-Scale Machine Learning Cluster Scheduling Via Multi-Agent Graph Reinforcement Learning

Different co-locations of jobs will lead to different levels of interference,
which encourage cluster operators to co-locate jobs with low levels of
interference to maximize training performance.

They notice that different levels of interference occurs when jobs training
*different types of models* are co-located. And the inter-job interference
is related to the *specific architecture*.

Applying one single RL scheduler to manage thousands of servers may results
in significant challenges as follow:
1. high dimension of input state
2. large action space
3. the scheduler need to collect and wait for all jobs submits their information
   to the cluster, both in training and execute phases. This will slow the
   training speed and extra scheduling delay.


So they design a multi-agent reinforcement learning frame, which allow
multiple schedulers to cooperatively schedule DL jobs within limited
neighborhood of the cluster.


For each scheduler:
1. encode the partition(self-overseeing) by one GNN, and broadcast this
   embedding to other schedulers
2. use other schedulers' embeddings and own features to generate state
   by another GNN
3. then a network for generating action for current cluster partition.
