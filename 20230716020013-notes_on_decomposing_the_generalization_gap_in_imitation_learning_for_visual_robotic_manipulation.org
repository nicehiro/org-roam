* Intro

What's are the *factors* that contribute most to the diffculty of *generalization* to new environment in vision-based robotic manipulation?

To answer this question, this paper characterize environmental variables as a combination of independent factors, namely the background, lighting conditions and so on.

* Highlights

The results are really helpful for future experiments on simu-to-real.

1. Random crop augmentation improves generalization. This rule actually used already.
2. Visual diversity from *out-of-domain data* dramatically improves generalization. For example, data from opening a fridge can improve performance on picking an object.

* Can be improved

Not read so deeply.
