#+title: Reinforcement Learning is Supervised Learning on Optimized Data

The whole article is interesting. It worth reading regularly.


The two most common perspectives on Reinforcement learning (RL) are optimization
and dynamic programming. Methods that compute the gradients of the non-differentiable
expected reward objective, such as the [[id:D56B0801-4B58-42E1-B9B0-4CDE76A5B657][REINFORCE]] trick are commonly grouped
into the optimization perspective, whereas methods that employ TD-learning
or Q-learning are dynamic programming methods.
