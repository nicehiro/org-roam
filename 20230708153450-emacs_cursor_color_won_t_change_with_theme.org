#+title: Emacs cursor color won't change with theme
#+filetags: :emacs:

There's both a cursor-color frame parameter and a cursor face. One of these settings may be overriding the other. Most themes will set the cursor face appropriately for dark/light frame background colours, so you might consider explicitly setting the cursor-color to nil so that you can rely on the theme's settings.

#+begin_src shell
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(cursor-color . nil))
#+end_src
