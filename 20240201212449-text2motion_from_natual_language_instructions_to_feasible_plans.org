#+title: Text2Motion: From Natual Language Instructions to Feasible Plans

It uses feasibility heuristics encoded in Q-functions of a library of skills to guide task planning.

The prior approaches adopt open-loop execution stategies, trusting LLMs to produce correct plans without verifying them on the symbolic or geometric level.

When a skill is executed, an action is sampled from its RL policy and fed to its primitive, executing a series of motor commands on the robot.

The planning objectives are:
1. Generate a trajectory of skills.
2. The skill sequence are feasible.


They propose a Geometric feasibility planner, which uses Q-functions evaluated from intial state to the final state.
