#+title: Emacs Org LaTeX Preview Error
#+filetags: :latex:orgmode:emacs:


Remember to check the ~*Org Preview LaTeX Output*~ buffer for detailed errors.

In my case, it was that Emacs cannot find the ~latex~ and ~dvipng~ command in Emacs, even if I have use ~exec-path-from-shell~ to obtain ~PATH~ from the system.

So the solution is to add symlinks of those two to ~/usr/local/bin~.
