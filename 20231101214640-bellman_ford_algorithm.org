Bellman-Ford, like [[id:35a9d3ff-9513-4522-b715-11be3858316e][Dijkstra's Algorithm,]] is also a algorithm to find a shortest path in a graph.

If $G$ has no negative cycles, then there is a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ that is simple (i.e., does not repeat nodes), and hence has at most $n-1$ edges.

Let $OPT(i,v)$ to denote the minimum cost of a $v-t$ path using at most $i$ edges.
Our problem is to compute $OPT(n-1,s)$.
