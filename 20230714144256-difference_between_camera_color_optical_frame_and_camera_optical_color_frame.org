#+title: Difference between camera_color_optical_frame and camera_optical_color_frame
#+filetags: :camera:ros:realsense:


~camera_link~ is the reference frame of the camera.

~_optical_frame~ is the original frame coordinate system.

In eye-hand calibration, we use ~_optical_frame~ as camera frame.
