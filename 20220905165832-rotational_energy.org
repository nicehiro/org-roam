#+title: Rotational Energy


Rotational energy is kinetic energy due to the rotation of an object and is part of its total kinetic energy.

\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\end{equation*}

where \(I\) is the [[id:A2039278-620A-47CB-8735-47BFDE715FF6][Moment of Inertia]] and \(\omega\) is the angular velocity.
