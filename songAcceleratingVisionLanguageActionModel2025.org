#+title: Accelerating Vision-Language-Action Model Integrated with Action Chunking via Parallel Decoding
#+filetags: :VLA:


The performance of VLA models can be improved by integrating with [[id:8995D417-172D-4B46-B7E3-A3269873A42F][Action Chunking]] for effective control. However, action chunking linearly scales up action dimensions in VLA models with increased chunking sizes. This paper aims to tackle this problem by proposing PD-VLA, a parallel decoding framework for VLA models. This paper tries to use Jacobi Decoding method in VLA model.
