#+title: Evaluating Uncertainty-based Failure Detection for Closed-Loop LLM Planners

This paper propose to use three criterion for quantifying the uncertainty of MLLMs, namely _token probability_, _entropy_, and _self-explained confidence_.

I'm not quite sure the difference between token probability and token entropy. I think those are same thing.

Anyway, this paper may provide one aspect of what I want to do.
