* Description
Importance Sampling is a technique for estimating the expectation $\mu$ of a
random variable $f(x)$ under distribution $p$ from samples of a different
distribution $q$.

The key observation is that $\mu$ is can expressed as the expectation of a
different random variable \(f^{\star}(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)} f(x)\) under $q$

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mu &= \mathbf{E}_{p}[f(x)] \\
&= \sum_{x} p(x)f(x) \\
&= \sum_{x} \frac{q(x)}{q(x)}p(x)f(x) \\
&= \sum_{x} \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} q(x)f(x) \\
&= \mathbf{E}_{q} \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} f(x) \\
&= \mathbf{E}_{q} [f^{*}(x)]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Technique condition: $q$ must have support everywhere $p$ dose.
Without this condition, the equation is biased!
Note: $q$ can support things that $p$ doesn't.
