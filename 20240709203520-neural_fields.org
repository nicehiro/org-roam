#+title: Neural Fields

Neural Fields is a mapping from spatial coordinates to scene properties, such as occupancy, color, radiance, etc, but unlike [[id:3f2b36c5-9c22-4afa-ab56-85be2bed6d02][Voxel Grids]] - in which the mapping is from a discrete cell to the value at that voxel - in a neural filed the mapping is a learned function, typically a multi-layer perceptron.
