#+title: Rapid Exploration for Open-World Navigation with Latent Goal Models
#+filetags: :robust:rl:

A robotic learning system must be robust to
1. the difference between an offline training dataset and the real world,
2. non-stationary changes in the real world(ignore visual distractors).


They consider the problem of navigating to a user-specified goal in a
previously unseen environment.


Broadly, their method, Rapid Exploration Controller for Outcome-driven
Navigation(RECON) consists of three separate stages:
1. learning a subgoal representation using [[ebib:alemiDeepVariationalInformation2019][Deep Variational Information Bottleneck]]
   architecture from offline data,
2. Using subgoals generated by previous trained goal model for data
   collection(new environment) and building a map in a new environment,
3. navigating to subgoals in the new environment.


Notice that the exploration and navigation is executing at the same time.
