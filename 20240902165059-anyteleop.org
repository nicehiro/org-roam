* Hand pose detection

Takeing RGB (minimal) or RGB-D as input, outputs:
1. local finger keypoint positions in the wrist frame by using MediaPipe
2. global 6D wrist pose in the camera frame by using Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm


* Hand pose retargeting
Minimizing the difference between the keypoint vectors of the human and robot hand.

\begin{equation*}
\min_{q_t} \sum_{i=0}^N || \alpha v_t^i - f_i(q_t) ||^2 + \beta || q_t - q_{t-1} ||^2
\end{equation*}

where $q_t$ represents the joint positions of the robot hand at time step $t$, $v_t^i$ is the $i$-th keypoint vector for human hand computed from the detected finger keypoints, $f(q_t)$ is the $i$-th forward kinematics function which takes the robot hand joint positions $q_t$ as input and computes the $i$-th keypoint vector for therobot hand, $q_l$ and $q_u$ are the lower and upper limits of the joint position, $\alpha$ is a scaling factor to account for hand size difference.
