#+title: Fuzzy set

+ Definition: A _membership function_ ranges from =0-1=, with a larger vlue indicating a higher degree of truth.

+ Union: max

+ Intersection: min

+ Relation: a fuzzy set $R(X, Y)$ defined on the Cartesian product of crisp sets

+ Composition: $B(Y) = A(X) \circle R(X, Y)$
  - $R(X, Y) \circle S(Y, Z) = \max \min [\mu_R(x, y), \mu_S(y, z)]$

+ General Extension Principle: max min

+ Mamdani Implication: $\sigma(a, b) = min[a, b]$

+ Represent of rules: For all inputs, take the "min" and "max" operation according to the rule statements

+ Defuzzification: center-of-area (COA) $= \frac{\sum u_i \mu(u_i)}{\sum \mu(u_i)}$
