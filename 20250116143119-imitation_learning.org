#+title: Imitation Learning


Imitation Learning (IL), also know as Learning from Demonstration (LfD), is a method where robots learn to perform tasks by mimicking human behavior.

Three essential steps exists in IL:

- capture the expert demonstration

- retarget demonstratiosns to robot motions

- train using the retargeted data


If the captured motion comes from the same robot, the retargeting step is unnecessary.
