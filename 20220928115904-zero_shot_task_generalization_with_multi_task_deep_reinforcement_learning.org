#+title: Zero-Shot Task Generalization with Multi-Task Deep Reinforcement Learning
#+filetags: :zsl:rl:multi-task:


This paper proposes a hierarchical RL architecture which consists of two modules: one meta controller for generate next subtask's parameters _by reading the subtask's instruction_; and one parameterized skill policy model to generalized in different picking tasks by using analogy-making methods.

Still by giving an instruction or sequence to do all subtasks.
